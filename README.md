K-means implementation project
==============================
_Here is a brief guide explaining how to use our project_

The purpose of the project is to implement a k-means algorithm designed to perform clusterisation of a dataset.

### Dependencies

Here is a list of libraries used:
* numpy
* matplotlib

### How to use it?

to launch the programm, please write in a shell `python kmeans.py datafile.txt`.  
`datafile.txt` contains data you want to process.
Each line defines one entry of the dataset and it should the following format:
`1st coordinate, 2nd, ..., n-th, label` representing the n coordinates of a point and its label.
